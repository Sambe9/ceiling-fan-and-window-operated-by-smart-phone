# ceiling-fan-and-window-operated-by-smart-phone

hey! Myself Srujan
This is mine first project in cisco packet tracer.
however this project is quiet simple a smart phone
controls the ceiling fan and window in living room.

here we use the homegate way as the server.

you can get a breif idea after observing the project.
